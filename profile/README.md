# Artalytics

**Authenticity. Trust. Insight.**

Artalytics is a platform that brings **confidence and transparency to digital art**.
We combine proprietary image analysis with modern web applications to:

* **Authenticate artworks** – verifying originality and creation process.
* **Issue Certificates of Authenticity (COAs)** – blockchain-backed, tamper-evident, and publicly searchable.
* **Showcase collections** – through interactive galleries that let anyone explore verified works.
* **Deliver insights** – offering artists and collectors data-driven perspectives on style, value, and provenance.
