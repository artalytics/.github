Here's how you can process your `video.mp4` to remove the white background from each frame, resize them, and compile them back into a WebM video with transparency.

### **Bash Script to Process Video Frames**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Create a temporary directory for frames
mkdir -p temp-frames

# Step 2: Extract frames from video.mp4
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 temp-frames/frame%04d.png

# Step 3: Process each frame
# Remove white background and resize to HD (1920x1920)
for frame in temp-frames/frame*.png; do
  # Remove white background with a fuzz factor (adjust fuzz percentage as needed)
  convert "$frame" -fuzz 0% -transparent white -resize 1920x1920 "$frame"
done

# Step 4: Create WebM video from processed frames with transparency
ffmpeg -y -framerate 30 -i temp-frames/frame%04d.png -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p output-video.webm

# Step 5: Clean up temporary frames
rm -rf temp-frames

echo "Video processing complete. Output file: output-video.webm"
```

**Save this script as `process_video.sh` and make it executable:**

```bash
chmod +x process_video.sh
```

**Then run the script:**

```bash
./process_video.sh
```

### **Explanation of the Script**

- **Step 1:** Creates a temporary directory called `temp-frames` to store the individual frames extracted from the video.

- **Step 2:** Uses `ffmpeg` to extract all frames from `video.mp4` and saves them as PNG images in the `temp-frames` directory.

  ```bash
  ffmpeg -i video.mp4 temp-frames/frame%04d.png
  ```

- **Step 3:** Processes each extracted frame using `ImageMagick`:

  - `-fuzz 5%`: Allows for slight variations when matching the white color to remove (adjust the percentage if needed).
  - `-transparent white`: Makes the white color transparent.
  - `-resize 1920x1920`: Resizes the image to 1920x1920 pixels (adjust dimensions as needed).

  ```bash
  for frame in temp-frames/frame*.png; do
    convert "$frame" -fuzz 5% -transparent white -resize 1920x1920 "$frame"
  done
  ```

- **Step 4:** Uses `ffmpeg` to create a WebM video from the processed frames, preserving the transparency:

  ```bash
  ffmpeg -y -framerate 30 -i temp-frames/frame%04d.png -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p output-video.webm
  ```

  - `-framerate 30`: Sets the output video frame rate to 30 frames per second.
  - `-c:v libvpx-vp9`: Specifies the VP9 codec for WebM format.
  - `-pix_fmt yuva420p`: Uses a pixel format that supports an alpha channel (transparency).

- **Step 5:** Cleans up by removing the temporary frames directory.

### **Notes and Tips**

- **Adjusting Fuzz Factor:**
  - The `-fuzz` parameter determines how closely a color needs to match to be considered for transparency.
  - If parts of your subject are becoming transparent, reduce the fuzz percentage.
  - If white areas remain in the background, increase the fuzz percentage slightly.

- **Resizing:**
  - The resize value `1920x1920` sets the frames to a square HD resolution.
  - Adjust the dimensions according to your desired output size while maintaining the aspect ratio if needed.

- **Dependencies:**
  - Ensure you have `ffmpeg` and `ImageMagick` installed on your system.
    - **For Ubuntu/Debian:**
# 
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install ffmpeg imagemagick
      ```

    - **For MacOS (using Homebrew):**

      ```bash
      brew install ffmpeg imagemagick
      ```

- **Permissions:**
  - The script assumes you have read and write permissions in the working directory.

- **Processing All Frames:**
  - Unlike your R script that processes only the first 10 frames, this Bash script processes all frames extracted from the video.
  - If you wish to process only a subset of frames, modify the `ffmpeg` command in Step 2 or adjust the loop accordingly.

### **Alternative: Using Only Bash Commands**

If you prefer to perform everything without creating a script file, you can run the commands directly in your terminal:

```bash
# Create a temporary directory
mkdir -p temp-frames

# Extract frames from video.mp4
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 temp-frames/frame%04d.png

# Process frames
for frame in temp-frames/frame*.png; do
  convert "$frame" -fuzz 5% -transparent white -resize 1920x1920 "$frame"
done

# Create WebM video with transparency
ffmpeg -y -framerate 30 -i temp-frames/frame%04d.png -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p output-video.webm

# Clean up
rm -rf temp-frames

echo "Video processing complete. Output file: output-video.webm"
```

### **Explanation of Differences**

- **All in Bash:**
  - This approach eliminates the need for R, streamlining your workflow.
  - It uses `ffmpeg` and `ImageMagick`, which are powerful tools for video and image processing in Bash.

- **No Need for Temporary Scripts:**
  - Since all commands are executed in Bash, you don't need to switch between R and Bash or manage intermediate scripts.

- **Processing Speed:**
  - Depending on the size of your video and the power of your machine, processing may take some time. Running everything in Bash can be more efficient.

### **Troubleshooting**

- **White Background Not Fully Removed:**
  - Adjust the `-fuzz` percentage higher to remove more shades of white.
  - Be cautious as setting it too high may make parts of your subject transparent if they are close in color to the background.

- **Video Transparency Issues:**
  - Ensure that the `-pix_fmt` is set to `yuva420p` to support an alpha channel.
  - Some video players may not support transparency in WebM videos. Test the output in a compatible player or within the context where it will be used (e.g., web browsers).

- **Errors About Frame Patterns:**
  - Make sure the frame pattern in the `ffmpeg` commands (`frame%04d.png`) matches the actual filenames generated.

### **Conclusion**

By converting your workflow entirely to Bash, you simplify the process and eliminate dependencies on R. The script provided uses standard tools available on most systems and can be easily adjusted to fit your specific needs.
