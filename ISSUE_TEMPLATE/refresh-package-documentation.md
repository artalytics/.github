Documentation, function descriptions, argument definitions, and code comments all need to be reviewed and refreshed where needed. Some may be leftover and stale, some may have placeholder values like 'tbd', and others may have completely wrong information. Ensure this package is documented and prepped for optimized onboarding of new developers, agents, or copilots, starting with the roxygen2 package documentation.
